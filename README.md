<p>
    An alternative javascript engine for Freeswitch based on <a href="https://bellard.org/quickjs/">quickjs engine</a>. <br>
    Most interesting features: <br>
    <ul>
     <li>more tightly integration with javascript (transferring objects between functions and so on)</li>
     <li>the possibility of operate with session media data and codecs</li>
     <li>the possibility of interrupt running script</li>
     <li>file management that similar to mod_spidermonkey way</li>
     <li>network functions (tcp/udp sockets and curl)</li>
     <li>threads support (in a development branch)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>    
    If you have any suggestions or ideas write me.
